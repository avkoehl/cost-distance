# Cost Distance Analysis

Find path between source point and target points
Find cost accumulation from source points

cost options:
- euclidean distance
- elevation change
- cell slope in max downhill direction

walls (unpassable cells) options: 
- nodata cells
- slope threshold
- enforce downhill path

Uses numba for performance
